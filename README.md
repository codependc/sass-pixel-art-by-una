# Sass Pixel Art by Una

2017.07.11 talk featuring Una on Sass Pixel Art

## Notes
- Using matrices to develop a blueprint for the pixel art
- Uses embedded for loops to generate
- Use `map-get` to obtain color values
- If there is a comma at the end of the generated string, CSS won't know what to do with it
- Created a mixin to allow you to replicate the pixel art generation
- Use `each` loop to generate class
