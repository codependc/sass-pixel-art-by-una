# Sass Pixel Art by Una

2017.07.11 talk featuring Una on Sass Pixel Art

## Notes
- Uses matrices to develop a blueprint for the pixel art
- Uses embedded for loops to generate
- Uses `map-get` to obtain color values
- If there is a comma at the end of the generated string for box shadow (?), CSS won't know what to do with it
- Creates a mixin for a reusable function for generating pixel art
- Use `each` loop to generate classes instead of manually defining classes
